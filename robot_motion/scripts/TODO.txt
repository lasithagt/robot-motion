On the simulation:

1. force control with kinematics done
2.0 add the other freedom to the table done 
2.1 orientation control with kinematics done
3. optimization of the redundancy not doing
	

After:
1. force control with dynamics:
	use the dynamic model developed
2. orientation control with redundancy
